### MindMeld
Social media encourages passive consumption: endless scrolling, fleeting attention, low-value engagement. MindMeld flips the script by embedding moments of intentional reflection into your everyday scroll, transforming addictive habits into mindful microbreaks.

## Design
MindMeld is a mobile app that mirrors the design and flow of typical social media platforms but injects meaningful, brain-boosting prompts into your feed. At first, you scroll through familiar bite-sized content like memes, short clips, visual updates, but thenthe pace shifts subtly. A prompt appears: “What's a challenge you've already overcome this week?” or “Name three things you’re grateful for right now.” These bite-sized reflections are timed and placed to catch users mid-scroll, creating a habit-forming loop of intentional thought. Users can keep reflections private, share them with close friends or groups, or explore how others in their circle responded for deeper connection. The app dynamically adapts based on user responses, preferences, and mood, using an LLM to generate hyper-personalized prompts and conversation threads, optionally facilitated by a social AI companion. MindMeld monetizes through premium reflection packs (e.g., “Creative Flow,” “Leadership Mindset,” “Emotional Awareness”) and through sponsorships from wellness brands, integrating their messages as playable or reflective content. Instead of feeding the doomscroll, we build micro-pathways to presence — one swipe at a time.
