### MindRest  
MindRest is a productivity companion that transforms your study time into a peaceful mental retreat — by building a virtual zoo that only grows when you stay focused. It’s designed to reward intentional, distraction-free time by turning your phone into a source of quiet motivation instead of interruption.

## Design  
MindRest is a mobile app that gently deters phone usage during focus sessions. When you start a study session, your screen locks into a serene, animated zoo habitat. As time passes without disruptions — like checking social media, messages, or quitting the app — your zoo slowly comes to life. Animals arrive, environments expand, and rare species appear based on the length and consistency of your focus.

Each animal or display is a visual reward and permanent addition to your zoo, creating a growing, custom world filled with creatures linked to your achievements. An AI zoo-keeper offers motivational commentary between sessions, records streaks, and gives helpful study reflections afterward. A social mode allows you to visit friends’ zoos — encouraging accountability, collaboration, and even cooperative habitats for study groups.

MindRest monetizes through in-app purchases like rare animal types, new environments (rainforest, savanna, mountains), and ambient soundscapes. With optional integration into calendar tools or Pomodoro timers, MindRest blends mindfulness, play, and productivity to help users reclaim focus in a world designed to steal it.
