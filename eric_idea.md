# ScrollSwap
Short-form content on social media is incredibly addictive, possibly due to how easy it is to start scrolling and stay in a passive mindset. ScrollSwap hijacks this urge to drive your mind back to active, engaged activity in the span of a single scrolling session.

## Design
ScrollSwap is a mobile app that looks like your social media feed, and each session starts off with passive content, but progressively transitions into small activites that people can think about or complete. For example, one such activity might be imagining your life as a movie in a sentence. Then, you can share your activities with friends, building a network aspect that keeps poeple engaged in taking control of their digital consumption. Feeds can also include what your friends have been up to recently on the platform. We can personalize content for users to the types of activities that they would enjoy doing. Each activity will be generated by an LLM, and can serve as the basis point for a conversation with a chatbot or a friend. The platform would be monetized by advertisements styled similarly to activities.
