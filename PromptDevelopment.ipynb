    "\n",
    "Each section will include:\n",
    "- A description, including input/output schemas\n",
    "- At least one sample input\n",
    "- Code to perform the task given the input\n",
    "- Tests to evaluate the implementation with different parameters\n",

    "**Note:** The prompts listed here are reordered and altered in responsibility to handling the scenarios compared to the past milestone as our understanding of the problem and the feasibility/scope of some of the steps changed. Each of the following scenarios integrates in a modular way with the rest of the system."

    "Chefing contains a main system prompt that informs the agent of its role and outlines the extra information it will need to process in context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, our main flow is to query long-term information about the user stored in an external location (preferences, restrictions, situation, past recipes) and add this to the main window. Finally, we await the user's first request, which is to suggest recipes. A picture of the fridge will be provided to the user as input for this step. This enables use case 3 immediately (recipe from fridge picture).\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the user may continue to add more messages to describe new requirements for the model, which we will classify as either long-term or short-term. We will output long-term information alongside the recipe to store in a vector DB. When the user provides good feedback on this recipe, we will save it for future retrieval. This enables use cases 1 (adaptive difficulty), 4 (planning), 5 (kitchen tools), and 6 (expiry information). To initialize this, we ask the user for a form.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will simulate usage scenario 2 (retrieval of stored long-term info) by using an embedding model and cosine similarity to see what prompts and data formats we can use to get useful information. This will be the section where we diverge from the structure of the rest of the sections."
